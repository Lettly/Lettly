## Hi there, I'm Marco ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m twenty years old and currently studying software engineer at Roma Tre.<br>
Iâ€™ve always had a passion for programming, in fact Iâ€™ve been programming since I was fourteen as a hobby, I started by learning Linux, and during my high school career Iâ€™ve coded and developed various sites and programs.<br>
### âš¡ Fun fact:<br>
- ðŸ“» For my final exam I turned in a web app that was an external application for Spotify, that allowed the user to choose the songs to play in a restaurant ([Lettly/YourMusic](https://github.com/Lettly/YourMusic)).
- ðŸ“’ Iâ€™ve recreated the my high school electronic register because the I didn't like the original one ([REDignus/web-server](https://github.com/REDignus/web-server)).
<br><br><i>I know my fun fact aren't so funny ðŸ¤·</i>
## ðŸŽµ I like listening to music, A LOT
